# django-recipe-app-api
My first Django project with a simple api for learning purposes.

To run the application, first, download and install Docker [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

After successful installation to start the project, run the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

The API will then be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000
